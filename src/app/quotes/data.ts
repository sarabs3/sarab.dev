    content: `Hiring great engineers is not enough.

You can have the smartest team in the world, but if they don't collaborate well, you're stuck.

If they can't communicate their ideas, projects will drag on.
If they don't care about the business, they'll build tech for the sake of tech.
A great engineering team isn't just about code quality.

It's about trust, ownership, and understanding the bigger picture.

Tech is easy. People are hard.`,
